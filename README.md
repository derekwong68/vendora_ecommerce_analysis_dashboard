# Summary of Insights

**Product Orders:**

● The Gaming Monitor had the most amount of orders in 2020, followed by Airpods and Macbook Air respectively. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, orders from 2019-2021 experienced a large spike followed by a slow decrease of volume in orders after 2021.

**Sales:**

● Though the gaming monitor had the highest amount of orders, Airpods generated the most sales and made up nearly 40-50% of all sales from 2019-2022. <br>
● Most of the sales were made through direct marketing channels with email in second.

**Avg Time to Ship:**

● Most products range from 3-4 days with the Bose Headphone and Apple iPhone ranging from 1 to 6 days due to having little orders.

# Recommendations & Next Steps

**Revenue and Product Trends:**

  ● **Focus on High-Performing Products:** AirPods and iPhones show significant sales volume but have seen a decline over time. Consider introducing new models, bundling deals, or discounts to rejuvenate sales. <br>
  ● **Phase Out Low-Performing Products:** Products like the Bose Headphones and Apple iPhones show consistently low sales. Analyze whether they are essential to the product lineup or if they can be phased out to focus on higher-performing items. 

**Marketing Channel Optimization:**

  ● Shift more budget and effort for the direct and mail marketing channels while reevaluating or or discontinuing the affiliate and social media marketing channels.
